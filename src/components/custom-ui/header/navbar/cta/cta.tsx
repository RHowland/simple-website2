 * File Name : cta.tsx
 * Component Name : Cta
 * Component Type : Call-to-action Component
 * Date Created : 2024-04-04
 * Dev Initials : Aniket Raj
 * ------------------------------
 * Question: Why was it necessary to create this component?
 * Answer: This component was created to provide a call-to-action section that encourages users to take a specific action, such as visiting a particular page or performing a desired task. It combines a text link and a button to create an engaging and interactive call-to-action.
 *
 * ------------------------------
 * Question: What does this component do?
 * Answer: The Cta component renders a call-to-action section that consists of a text link and a button. The text link is created using the Next.js Link component, which allows navigation to a specific page. The button is created using a custom Button component, which is imported from "@/components/ui/button". The component applies styling classes using Tailwind CSS to ensure a consistent and visually appealing appearance.
 *
 * ------------------------------
 * Section Comments:
 * Section 1: Call-to-action link
 * This section represents the text link part of the call-to-action. It uses the Next.js Link component to create a clickable link that navigates to the "/" page when clicked. The link text is set to "Find out about page twelve". Tailwind CSS classes are applied to style the link, including text size, color, and margin/padding.
 *
 * Section 2: Call-to-action button
 * This section represents the button part of the call-to-action. It uses a custom Button component, which is imported from "@/components/ui/button". The button text is set to "Page Twelve". The Button component is likely to have its own styling and behavior defined in its respective file.
 *

 *
 * ------------------------------
 * Output Comments:
 * The component outputs a call-to-action section that consists of a text link and a button. The link navigates to the "/" page when clicked, and the button provides an interactive element for users to engage with.
 *
 * ------------------------------
 * Additional Comments:
 * Question: Did you have to write any unusual code?
 * Answer: No, the code in this component follows a standard pattern for creating a call-to-action section. It utilizes the Next.js Link component for navigation and a custom Button component for the interactive button element. The use of Tailwind CSS classes for styling is a common practice in modern web development.
